# Random Game Selector for GOG Galaxy 2.0

## Description:
Tested in Python 3.10.2

Uses internal python libraries so you don't need anything else!
All random selection done on the pure query, you can also filter by tag or to not include game pass games if you want
(for example you have a backlog selected and want a random game to play from it)

Note: The path for the database file is hardcoded (for now) to the default installation path of GOG Galaxy, so if you have it installed somewhere else, be sure to change the path.

Have Fun!
