# Random Game Picker for GOG Galaxy 2.0

## Description:
Tested in Python 3.10.2

Uses internal python libraries so you don't need anything else!

-- All random selection done by querying the database file
-- You can filter by tag or to not include game pass (subscription) games if you want
(for example you have a list of games tagged as 'backlog' and want a random game to play from it, or your gamepass expired but the games still show up on the library)

Note: The path for the database file is hardcoded (for now) to the default installation path of GOG Galaxy, so if you have it installed somewhere else, be sure to change the path.

Have Fun!
